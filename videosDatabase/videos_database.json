When sunlight touches the leaves, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using the energy from the sun, they mix these ingredients together. The result? Delicious food that helps them grow strong and healthy! And that's not all. During photosynthesis, plants also release oxygen into the air, which is essential for us to breathe. So, every time you take a deep breath, remember that plants are hard at work making food and keeping our air clean. Isn't nature incredible?",

Zomato is gearing up for growth, particularly in the Quick Commerce sector, backed by improving profitability and reduced losses in key areas. India's food delivery market is still developing, with urban populations expected to rise significantly by 2030, providing robust opportunities. Currently, over 34% of India’s population resides in urban areas, which bodes well for increased food consumption, contributing a quarter of the nation’s GDP. Notably, the younger demographic, with a median age of 28, combined with rising internet penetration, is set to fuel this growth further. Zomato stands out with its farm-to-fork approach and extensive restaurant network, which enhances its B2B operations. In Quick Commerce, significant revenue growth is expected as the market could expand ten to fifteen times by 2025. Even in its early stages, capturing market share in this sector could lead to substantial revenue increases for Zomato.",
