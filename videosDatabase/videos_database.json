Using sunlight, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Inside their leaves, they mix these ingredients together. Just like a chef creating a delicious meal, plants use the energy from sunlight to cook up food. But that’s not all! This amazing process also helps our planet. As plants take in carbon dioxide, they release oxygen, which we breathe. So, the next time you see a green plant, remember: they are not just standing there. They are busy working hard, creating food and oxygen for us all! Isn’t nature amazing?",

This unique approach sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with some praising the airline for infusing fun and culture into travel, while others had mixed feelings about the unconventional in-flight experience.

                "used_script": "Today, we are excited to announce a BUY recommendation on Zomato, with a Target Price of Rs 280 per share, reflecting a potential upside of 23%. Zomato is strategically expanding in the Quick Commerce sector, leading to improved profitability and reduced losses. The food delivery sector is still in its infancy in India, with the urban population set to grow from 34-35% to 42-43% by 2030. This shift in urbanization opens up significant market opportunities aligned with evolving consumer preferences. Food consumption accounts for a quarter of India’s GDP, and with a youthful population and increasing internet access, the food delivery market is ripe for growth. Zomato's unique farm-to-fork approach and strong restaurant network are key differentiators in its B2B operations. Additionally, while the Quick Commerce segment is emerging, it is projected to explode in size, offering substantial revenue growth potential. As per Redseer, this market could expand by 10-15 times by 2025. With these factors in play, Zomato is well-positioned for success.",
